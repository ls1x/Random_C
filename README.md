# Random_C

A collection of small C projects and experiments that I found interesting enough to share.  
This repository serves as a space to explore ideas, practice fundamentals, and document my learning process.

## What You'll Find

- Small programs and utilities
- Algorithm implementations
- Experiments with data structures and system concepts
- Random tests and prototypes

## Purpose

To build a personal library of C code that can be revisited, improved, and used as reference â€” both for myself and for anyone learning the language.

## How to Run

Compile any `.c` file using `gcc`:

```bash
- `gcc program.c -o program`
- `./program`
